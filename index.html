            <h3>(05/26/25) Extra Info On New Features</h3>
            <p>
               I've made a page explaining some specific features of the new edit system. <a href="edithelp.html">Click here</a> to open it.<br>Also note that the "Latest Additions" tab and "Random Band" button do not feature new bands. This will be fixed in the next update, which should be released in June.

            <font color="#ff0000"><h3><i>(05/26/25) Biggest Update By Far</font></i></h3>
            <p>This update has been a work in progress since the start of the site. You can finally edit and add information yourself! No more filling out and submitting a form then waiting for it to get added. All you have to do is log in, go to a page, and press edit. We also now have a logo, and the "points" leaderboard was replaced by a "band's added" leaderboard. Some of the new features might be a little confusing at first so I'll explain a few. When a band is flagged, it means it's outdated or inaccurate. You can see these flags in the bands list, and you can toggle them on the band page. To edit a page, look at the title (eg: Black Flag) and there will be an edit button to the right of it. Click that and you'll be brought to the edit page. After you edit some details, they should save and publish instantly. In the case of someone messing up a release's info, you can flag the release as 'Delete' or 'Restore'. If the release isn't real and someone only created it to screw around, then you should mark it as 'Delete'. If someone edited the info of an already existing release, you should mark it as 'Restore'. These release flags exist for admins to come and fix things, but users are welcome to help with restoration too.</p>
